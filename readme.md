## Introduction
Using this Laravel package you can use most of the Sendinblue methods. I had have implemented all the ends point for Contacts, Senders and Account. This package can easily keep implementing the methods for all the other endspoints mentioned in the php package from sendinblue (https://github.com/sendinblue/APIv3-php-library)

Follow the Sendinblue API documentation to understand their requirements and use this package https://developers.sendinblue.com/reference/getting-started-1
